## Become A Podling PMC member of Apache Celeborn
Anyone being supportive of the community and working in any of the CoPDoC areas can become an Apache Celeborn Podling PMC(PPMC) member. The CoPDoC is an acronym from ASF to describe how we recognize your contributions not only by code.

- Community - You can join us via our mailing list, issue trackers, discussions page to interact with community members, and share vision and knowledge
- Project - a clear vision and consensus are needed
- Documentation - without it, the stuff remains only in the minds of the authors
- Code - discussion goes nowhere without code


Apache Celeborn community strives to be meritocratic. Thus, once someone has contributed sufficiently to any area of CoPDoC they can be a candidate for PPMC membership and at last voted in as a Celeborn PPMC member. The PPMC should take an active role in watching committers develop as community participants.

## PPMC member requirements:
There are no strict rules for becoming a PPMC member. Candidates for new PPMC member are typically committers that are stilling actively participate in the community development after obtaining the committer membership, or contributors and community members that make significant contributions to the community for both code and contributor develop.

It is a clear goal of Celeborn to have all committers participate in the PPMC based on their contributions, which are considered at a community level (not just a technical one).

#### Continuous contributions
PPMC member candidates should have a decent amount of continuous engagements and contributions (fixing bugs, adding new features, writing documentation, maintaining issues boards, code review, mentoring new contributors, and answering community questions) to the Celeborn codebase and community.

- +5 months with light activity and engagement.
- +4 months of medium activity and engagement.
- +3 month with solid activity and engagement.

#### Quality of contributions
- A solid general understanding of the project
- Well tested, well-designed, following Apache Celeborn coding standards, and simple patches.
