Monitoring
===

There are two ways to monitor Celeborn cluster: prometheus metrics and REST API.

# Metrics

Celeborn has a configurable metrics system based on the
[Dropwizard Metrics Library](http://metrics.dropwizard.io/4.2.0).
This allows users to report Celeborn metrics to a variety of sinks including HTTP, JMX, CSV
files and prometheus servlet. The metrics are generated by sources embedded in the Celeborn code base.
They provide instrumentation for specific activities and Celeborn components.
The metrics system is configured via a configuration file that Celeborn expects to be present
at `$CELEBORN_HOME/conf/metrics.properties`. A custom file location can be specified via the
`spark.metrics.conf` [configuration property](https://celeborn.apache.org/configuration/#metrics).
Instead of using the configuration file, a set of configuration parameters with prefix
`celeborn.metrics.conf.` can be used.

Celeborn's metrics are decoupled into two
_instances_ corresponding to Celeborn components.  The following instances are currently supported:

* `master`: The Celeborn cluster master process.
* `worker`: A Celeborn cluster worker process.

Each instance can report to zero or more _sinks_. Sinks are contained in the
`org.apache.celeborn.common.metrics.sink` package:

* `CSVSink`: Exports metrics data to CSV files at regular intervals.
* `PrometheusServlet`: Adds a servlet within the existing Celeborn REST API to serve metrics data in Prometheus format.
* `GraphiteSink`: Sends metrics to a Graphite node.

The syntax of the metrics configuration file and the parameters available for each sink are defined
in an example configuration file,
`$CELEBORN_HOME/conf/metrics.properties.template`.

When using Celeborn configuration parameters instead of the metrics configuration file, the relevant
parameter names are composed by the prefix `celeborn.metrics.conf.` followed by the configuration
details, i.e. the parameters take the following form:
`celeborn.metrics.conf.[instance|*].sink.[sink_name].[parameter_name]`.
This example shows a list of Celeborn configuration parameters for a CSV sink:
```
"celeborn.metrics.conf.*.sink.csv.class"="org.apache.celeborn.common.metrics.sink.GraphiteSink"
"celeborn.metrics.conf.*.sink.csv.period"="1"
"celeborn.metrics.conf.*.sink.csv.unit"=minutes
"celeborn.metrics.conf.*.sink.csv.directory"=/tmp/
```

Default values of the Celeborn metrics configuration are as follows:
```
*.sink.prometheusServlet.class=org.apache.celeborn.common.metrics.sink.PrometheusServlet
```

Additional sources can be configured using the metrics configuration file or the configuration
parameter `spark.metrics.conf.[component_name].source.jvm.class=[source_name]`. At present the
no source is the available optional source. For example the following configuration parameter
activates the Example source:
`"celeborn.metrics.conf.*.source.jvm.class"="org.apache.celeborn.common.metrics.source.ExampleSource"`

## List of available metrics providers

Metrics used by Celeborn are of multiple types: gauge, counter, histogram, meter and timer,
see [Dropwizard library documentation for details](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/4.2.0/getting-started.html).
The following list of components and metrics reports the name and some details about the available metrics,
grouped per component instance and source namespace.
The most common time of metrics used in Celeborn instrumentation are gauges and counters.
Counters can be recognized as they have the `.count` suffix. Timers, meters and histograms are annotated
in the list, the rest of the list elements are metrics of type gauge.
The large majority of metrics are active as soon as their parent component instance is configured,
some metrics require also to be enabled via an additional configuration parameter, the details are
reported in the list.

# REST API

In addition to viewing the metrics, Celeborn also support REST API. This gives developers
an easy way to create new visualizations and monitoring tools for Celeborn and
also easy for users to get the running status of the service. The REST API is available for
both master and worker. The endpoints are mounted at `host:port`. For example,
for the master, they would typically be accessible
at `http://<master-prometheus-host>:<master-prometheus-port><path>`, and
for the worker, at `http://<worker-prometheus-host>:<worker-prometheus-port><path>`.

The configuration of `<master-prometheus-host>`, `<master-prometheus-port>`, `<worker-prometheus-host>`, `<worker-prometheus-port>` as below:

| Key                                     | Default | Description                | Since |
|-----------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------|-------|

| celeborn.master.metrics.prometheus.port | 9098    | Master's Prometheus port.  | 0.2.0 |
| celeborn.worker.metrics.prometheus.host | 0.0.0.0 | Worker's Prometheus host.  | 0.2.0 |
| celeborn.worker.metrics.prometheus.port | 9096    | Worker's Prometheus port.  | 0.2.0 |
