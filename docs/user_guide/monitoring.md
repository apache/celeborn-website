Monitoring
===

There are two ways to monitor Celeborn cluster: prometheus metrics and REST API.

# Metrics

# REST API

In addition to viewing the metrics, Celeborn also support REST API. This gives developers
an easy way to create new visualizations and monitoring tools for Celeborn and
also easy for users to get the running status of the service. The REST API is available for
both master and worker. The endpoints are mounted at `host:port`. For example,
for the master, they would typically be accessible
at `http://<master-prometheus-host>:<master-prometheus-port><path>`, and
for the worker, at `http://<worker-prometheus-host>:<worker-prometheus-port><path>`.

The configuration of `<master-prometheus-host>`, `<master-prometheus-port>`, `<worker-prometheus-host>`, `<worker-prometheus-port>` as below:

| Key                                     | Default | Description                | Since |
|-----------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------| ----- |
| celeborn.master.metrics.prometheus.host | 0.0.0.0 | Master's Prometheus host.  | 0.2.0 |
| celeborn.master.metrics.prometheus.port | 9098    | Master's Prometheus port.  | 0.2.0 |
| celeborn.worker.metrics.prometheus.host | 0.0.0.0 | Worker's Prometheus host.  | 0.2.0 |
| celeborn.worker.metrics.prometheus.port | 9096    | Worker's Prometheus port.  | 0.2.0 |

API path listed as below:

| Path                       | Service        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                              |
