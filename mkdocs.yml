  Apache Celeborn is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the
  Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
  the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
  other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or
  stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.<br>
